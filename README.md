# blackmarket-reloaded

After the small success of Blackmarket, I decided to create a new Blackmarket incremental-game.

What I plan to add :

  - Player stats : level, exp.
  - Gangs : fight others gangs and gain reputation.
  - Actions : more actions to do.
  - Production : create and sell a lot of things.
  - Prestige : gain prestige exp.

This game is totally text-based, build with Bootstrap, Angular-JS, jQuery.

## Run the game locally.

1. Download the full repo.
2. Run `npm install` on the repo folder to install all dependencies.
3. Start your cmd on the repo folder and emulate a local server with the command `http-server .` then go to `localhost:8080` (it's by default)

## Wanna help?

Do you have ideas, code suggestion or other?

You can create an issue or fork the repo to suggest code changes.
